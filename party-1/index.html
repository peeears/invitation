        The last party I enjoyed is the <sup>Mid-autumn Festival Party</sup>  hold by myself. I spend <ins>the whole afternoon</ins> to prepare foods and encourage everyone to bring the food they make to share together. It's a big dinner with shared foods and drinks. My friend's mom made <mark>mooncakes</mark>. After dinner, it's night time, moon comes out. We eat mooncake and appciate the most <ins>roundest</ins> <mark>moon</mark> in the period of the year. We also had karaoke together.

    <h3>How did you hear about this party? How were you invited?</h3>
    <div class="my-fun-class">
      <p>
This is a <em>tradition</em> passes down from the previous Chinese students. I was invited once when I first come to New Haven, new to the school and the environment. So this time I am the one who invite people. Me and my roomate made a small poster and we sent emails to invite people.
